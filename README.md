# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Notes for the AI Prototyper

-   Do not modify any AI-related code (Genkit, Vertex AI, etc.) unless specifically instructed.
-   Do not create or reference a `/workspace` directory in file paths. Use absolute paths from the project root.
