- Lifecycle Stages Documentation: Record information for each lifecycle stage (Design, Development, Training, Validation, Deployment, Operation, Retirement) to produce a Lifecycle Overview & Control Sheet.
- Automated Risk Analysis: Automatically assess risks (privacy, bias, etc.) based on use-case, data, model type, and user group, suggesting mitigations and mapping to ISO 42001 controls, to compile an AI Risk Register.
- Governance & Controls Checklist: Implement a toggle/selection system for governance policies, version control, explainability strategies, monitoring, logging, and change management to create a Control Implementation Sheet.
- AI Technical File Generation: Automatically generate a comprehensive AI Lifecycle Technical File (ISO 42001) in PDF/Word format, containing system definition, lifecycle overview, risk analysis, controls, and more.  The LLM will act as a tool for collecting and integrating all the inputs.
